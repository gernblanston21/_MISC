CGLINK-BUILDER-IN_v16.2 Instructions

- Add CGLINK-BUILDER-IN_v16.2.txt to your keyboard file as a script and assign it to a key

- This script combines the "Build From Loaded CG_Ticker Page" button & the "IN" button on the BallyBar tab of the VTW.

- It also lets you take any page where the scene used is L3_TeamPlyrStat, L3_PlyrNote, L3_Plyr0Fer, L3_0forAvg, L3_TeamComp or NU_WinProb and flip that page into a CG_Ticker page
	- Call up the page you want to use like a "L3_TeamPlyrStat" you have saved for a player.
	- Press the key you assigned the CGLINK-BUILDER-IN_v16 script to once and this will flip it to a corresponding CG_Ticker Scene.
	- Press the CGLINK-BUILDER-IN_v16 key again to insert it on the Bally Bar.
	- If the Scene you have on canvas is already a CG_Ticker page you only need to press the CGLINK-BUILDER-IN_v16 key once.
	
- The L3_TeamComp will flip single stats from column 1. I will be adding more scenes that can flip to a CG_Ticker Scene including L3_TeamComp with stats from column 1 & 2

- The NU_WinProb nub can also be flipped to a CG_Ticker Scene.
	- Make sure you have selected the League and game you want on the Win Prob% tab of the VTW.
	- You can save that NU_WinProb Nub to a page number for easier recall.
	- With the NU_WinProb Nub on your canvas, press the CGLINK-BUILDER-IN_v16 key once to flip it to a CG_Ticker Scene.
	- The script will automatically refresh the Win Prob% data
	- Press the CGLINK-BUILDER-IN_v16 key again to insert it on the Bally Bar.

- The current CG_Ticker Scenes that can be inserted to the Bally Bar from the Viz are:
	- CG_Ticker_PlayerStats
	- CG_Ticker_TeamStats
	- CG_Ticker_TeamComp
	- CG_Ticker_2TeamNote

- More Scenes will be added soon. If there is a Scene that you think would work being flipped to a CG_Ticker Scene email me your suggestion at ReisGraphics@gmail.com
